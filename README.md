# JS-SYNCHRONIOUS-CALLBACK-FUNCTION
In JavaScript, a callback is synchronous if it is executed immediately after the completion of the function that it's passed to.
The script starts executing from the top. "HURRAY" is logged to the console.
tall(grow); is called, passing the grow function as a callback to the tall function.
Inside tall, height is set to 55 and "YEAH" is assigned to the variable crazy. Then, it logs 55 to the console.
The callback(); line inside tall invokes the grow function, which reassigns age to 20 and logs 20 to the console.
After the callback, "YEAH" is logged to the console.
Finally, "gaddemit" is logged to the console.
